# MeshGo Implementation Progress

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Days 1-3)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Go module with proper structure
   - Set up dependencies (Qt bindings, SQLite, serial, notifications, tray)
   - Create basic directory structure following clean architecture principles

2. **Domain Models**
   - Define core structs: Node, Chat, Message, User, Position, DeviceMetrics
   - Implement domain interfaces for persistence and transport
   - Add signal quality mapping (RSSI/SNR → Good/Fair/Bad)

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Implement SQLite schema with migrations
   - Create MessageStore, NodeStore, SettingsStore implementations
   - Add proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Phase 2: Transport & Protocol (Days 4-6)
1. **Transport Implementations**
   - SerialTransport with device detection and framing
   - TCPTransport with keepalive and proper error handling
   - Transport interface with auto-reconnect capabilities

2. **Meshtastic Protocol**
   - MeshPacket encoding/decoding using protobuf
   - Port number routing (TEXT_MESSAGE_APP, POSITION_APP, ROUTING_APP)
   - RadioClient implementation with packet handling

3. **Reconnection Logic**
   - Exponential backoff with jitter (1s → 60s max)
   - State machine: Connecting → Connected → Disconnected → Retrying
   - Graceful handling of USB unplug/network failures

### Phase 3: System Integration (Days 7-9)
1. **Notifications & Tray**
   - Cross-platform notifications (libnotify, toast, NSUserNotification)
   - System tray with unread badge and context menu
   - Focus detection to suppress notifications

2. **Settings Management**
   - JSON config file in user config directory
   - Runtime settings for connection, notifications, logging
   - Settings validation and migration

3. **Event System**
   - Channel-based event bus for UI updates
   - Event types: MessageReceived, NodeUpdated, ConnectionStateChanged
   - Thread-safe event dispatch to UI layer

### Phase 4: UI Implementation (Days 10-14)
1. **UI Adapter Interface**
   - Abstract UI interface for framework swapping
   - Define required operations: ShowMain, UpdateChats, UpdateNodes, etc.
   - Build tag system for selecting UI backend

2. **UI Implementation (Qt preferred)**
   - Main window with vertical tab rail (Chats, Nodes, Settings)
   - Chat view with bubble messages and input box
   - Node list with filtering, signal quality, and context menus
   - Settings panel for connection, notifications, logging

3. **UI Polish**
   - Native look and feel per platform
   - Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
   - Error dialogs and status indicators

### Phase 5: Testing & Packaging (Days 15-16)
1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for transport, protocol, and persistence
   - Integration tests with fake transport
   - UI tests for view models and state management

2. **Build System**
   - Cross-platform build with Go 1.24+
   - Makefile for build, test, package targets
   - Version embedding via ldflags

3. **Packaging**
   - Linux: AppImage + .deb/.rpm
   - Windows: MSIX or signed installer
   - macOS: .app bundle with notarization
